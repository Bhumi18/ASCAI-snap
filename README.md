# ASCAI: Enhancing Blockchain Transparency with MetaMask Snap 🌐🔒

ASCAI simplifies blockchain interactions by providing a **MetaMask Snap** that simulates contract transactions before confirmation. Designed for both technical and non-technical users, it empowers informed decision-making through clear and actionable insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview
When interacting with smart contracts, users often lack clarity about what happens in the backend. ASCAI bridges this gap by:
- **Simulating transactions** with [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) to preview potential outcomes.
- **Providing insights** through intuitive visuals and alerts for detected vulnerabilities.
- **Leveraging AI** to process transaction data and explain it in simple terms using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
